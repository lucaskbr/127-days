## Day 001 

## Time Spent
Coding: 1 hour

## Progress
Solved Top K Frequent Elements without checking the solution

## Challenges/Topics

- How to reverse a dictionary in python
- Improve better the concept of heap

## Observations

- I need to use tuples more frequently
- I need to practice more on reversing dictionaries
- I had to check how to perform the sorting of a dictionary

## Code:
```
class Solution(object):
    def topKFrequent(self, nums, k):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type k: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        
        seen = {}
        result = []

        for n in nums:
            if seen.get(n) == None:
                seen[n] = 0
            
            seen[n] = seen[n] + 1

        sorted_seen = sorted(seen.items(), key=lambda x:x[1], reverse=True)

        for i, t in enumerate(sorted_seen):
            print(t)
            result.append(t[0])
                
            if i == (k - 1):
                break
        
        return result
```
