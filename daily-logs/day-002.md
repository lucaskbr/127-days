## Day 002

## Time Spent
Coding: 1 hour

## Progress
Tried to solve Product of Array Except self

My code passed the first tests, but failed the test case when the input was larger

I refactored the code to improve the time complexity, but i struggled to pass the other test cases like when there were 0s in the array

I stopped the code and checked the solution to understand the logic, I wasnt able to get 100% of the solution

I need to redouble my efforts to understand the logic of the problem

## Challenges/Topics

- Didnt saw the edge cases of the problem

## Observations

- I took a lot of time to understand the question

## Code:
```
class Solution(object):
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        result = []
        
        pointer = 0
        for i, n in enumerate(nums):
            product = 1
            if (n == 0):
                product = 0
            else:   
                while pointer < len(nums):
                    
                    if pointer != i:
                        product = product * nums[pointer]
                    
                    pointer = pointer + 1

            pointer = 0
            result.append(product)
        return result

```

```
class Solution(object):
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        product = 0
        zeroIndexes = []
        for i, n in enumerate(nums):
            if n == 0:
                zeroIndexes.append(i)
                continue
            if i == 0:
                product = 1 * n
            else:
                product = product * n

        result = []

        for i, n in enumerate(nums):
            count = 0
            if len(zeroIndexes) > 2:
                result.append(0)
            elif i in zeroIndexes:
                count = product
            else:
                count = product / n
            result.append(count)
                
        return result

```
