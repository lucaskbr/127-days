## Day 003

## Time Spent
Studying: 1 hour

## Progress
Tried to understand the logic of the problem "Product of Array Except self"

I saw some videos about the problem/solution

I found a new concept of "prefix sums" that i need to study more

Im not comfortable with this way of thinking/solving the problem yet


## Challenges/Topics

- A wild "prefix sums" concept appeared

## Observations

- Most of my time i spent trying to understand the problem
- Did the kata of copy the solution in the code editor  

## Code:
```
class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(nums)
        res = [0] * n
        preffix = [0] * n
        suffix = [0] * n

        preffix[0] = 1
        suffix[n - 1] = 1

        for i in range(1, n):
            preffix[i] = nums[i - 1] * preffix[i - 1]

        for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
            suffix[i] = nums[i + 1] * suffix[i + 1]
        
        for i in range(n):
            res[i] = preffix[i] * suffix[i]
        
        return res
        
```
