## Day 004

## Time Spent
Studying/Coding: 1 hour

## Progress
Focused to understand the logic of the problem "Product of Array Except self"

I saw more videos about the problem/solution

This one helped me a lot: https://youtu.be/5bS636lE_R0


## Challenges/Topics

- The concept of prefix sums is more clear, but i need to practice more

## Observations

- I will need to revisit this problem soon

- This tip to understand the problem was gold:

```
Replace the numbers with variables.

If we have the array [A B C D]
we want to return [BCD, ACD, ABD, ABC]

```

## Code:
```
class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        size = len(nums)
        preffix = [0] * size
        suffix = [0] * size

        preffix[0] = 1
        suffix[size - 1] = 1

        for i in range(1, size):
            preffix[i] = preffix[i - 1] * nums[i - 1]

        for i in range((size - 1), 0, -1):
            suffix[i - 1] = suffix[i] * nums[i]

        for i in range(0, size):
            nums[i] = preffix[i] * suffix[i]
        
        return nums

```
