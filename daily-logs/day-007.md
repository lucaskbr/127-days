## Day 007

## Time Spent
Coding: 1 hour

## Progress
Focused to solve "Longest Consecutive Sequence" problem

## Challenges/Topics

- NA

## Observations

- My solution Beats 18.55% of other solutions
- I was able to solve without checking other solutions
- It was a pretty straightforward question, but there is a lot to be improved
- I wasnt able to keepup with my study routine sequence


## Code:
```
class Solution(object):
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        
        nums.sort()

        previous = 0
        interation = None
        result = 0

        print(nums)
        
        for n in nums:
            if interation == None:
                interation = 1
            elif previous == n:
                continue
            elif (n-1) == previous:
                interation = interation + 1
            else:
                interation = 1
            
            previous = n

            if interation > result:
                result = interation

        return result
```
