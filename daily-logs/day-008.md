## Day 008

## Time Spent
Coding: 1 hour

## Progress
Focused to improve the solution of "Valid Sudoku" problem

## Challenges/Topics

- Im still having some difficulties with matrix

## Observations

- My solution Beats 92.53% of other solutions
- A good improvement to be honest, my first attempt was only 5.24% of other solutions
- I was able to solve most of the code without looking, but the grid scenario wasnt working, i checked other solutions and my index logic was wrong, but besides that the solution was perfect


## Code:
```
class Solution(object):
    def isValidSudoku(self, board):
        """
        :type board: List[List[str]]
        :rtype: bool
        """
        rows = defaultdict(set)
        columns = defaultdict(set)
        grids = defaultdict(set)


        for i, row in enumerate(board):
            for j, value in enumerate(row):
                if value == ".":
                    continue

                if value in rows[i]:
                    print("row")

                    return False
                
                if value in columns[j]:
                    print("column")

                    return False

                grid_index = (i // 3) * 3 + (j // 3)

                if value in grids[grid_index]:
                    return False

                rows[i].add(value)
                columns[j].add(value)
                grids[grid_index].add(value)
        return True
```
