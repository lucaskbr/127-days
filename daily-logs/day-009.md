## Day 009

## Time Spent
Coding/Studying: 1 hour

## Progress
Focused to improve the solution of "Longest Consecutive Sequence" problem

## Challenges/Topics

- I had some difficulties to find the pattern of missing left number of the group

## Observations

- My solution Beats 74.79% of other solutions
- I had to check for other solutions in order to find the pattern of missing left number of the group
- Im feeling way more confident with python syntax and typing way faster

## Code:
```
class Solution(object):
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """

        non_repeated_nums = set(nums)
        result = 0

        for n in non_repeated_nums:
            left_number = n -1
            
            if left_number in non_repeated_nums:
                continue
            
            counter = 1

            while True:
                if (n + counter) in non_repeated_nums:
                    counter += 1
                else:
                    break
            if counter > result:
                result = counter
        return result
```
