## Day 010

## Time Spent
Coding/Studying: 1 hour

## Progress
Focused to review the previous challenges and patterns
- Top K Frequent Elements
- Longest Consecutive Sequence
- Valid Parentheses

## Challenges/Topics

- Keeping the solution with a good code complexity sometimes is hard
- A lot of patterns and a good foundation is required to not lose the "howto" when the time pass by

## Observations

- I was able to remember a lot of patterns from the top of my head, but some of them I struggled
- I forgot to use set - I was over using dict
- I stopped the challenges because of other priorizations
- Its harder than it seems to keep up with a streak when life is happening
